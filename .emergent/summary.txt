The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative development approach, completing a robust MVP for an invoice and project management system. Key accomplishments include implementing core features like BOQ processing, project/invoice management with complex partial billing (RA1/RA2+ GST logic), comprehensive PDF generation, and fixing critical synchronization and UI/UX issues. The engineer successfully achieved 100% test coverage for both backend and frontend, including newly added features like the PDF Text Extraction Engine for PO processing and a database clear option for super admins. The work then transitioned to implementing a large set of new enterprise-level enhancements, starting with Company Profile Management and initiating GST logic upgrades and dynamic RA bill tracking, which is the current focus.

The overarching goal is to develop a web-based invoice and project management tool, inspired by Refrens.com's UI/UX, using Activus Design & Build's brand colors. The primary problem solved is streamlining BOQ upload, project tracking, invoice generation, including complex partial billing, and ensuring GST compliance.

Implemented features include: multi-role user management, intelligent Excel BOQ upload, Performa/Tax invoice creation with RA1/RA2+ GST logic, dynamic PDF generation (client logo, GST breakup, e-signature, currency, branding), advance received tracking, percentage completion display, Item Master, Smart Filters/Search, Reports/Insights, Bank Guarantee section scaffolding, and a PDF Text Extraction Engine for PO Processing. Critical fixes addressed correct unit/rate extraction from BOQ, visible GST dropdown, proper RA invoice display, invoice data synchronization, and general UI/UX enhancements. A Clear DB option for super admins was recently added and verified.

The current phase involves significant enhancements:
1.  **Company Details Enhancement:** Manage multiple company locations/bank details, assign defaults, and select during project/invoice creation.
2.  **GST Logic Upgrade:** Define GST type (C&S GST/IGST) per invoice/item, item-level GST mapping for RA bills, and dynamic display of Overall/Used/Balance QTY in line items. Prevent invoice creation if Balance QTY is exceeded.
3.  **RA Bill & Quantity Tracking:** Dynamic RA table generation, auto-calculation of balance quantity, and cumulative GST logic per line item.
4.  **Project Metadata & PO Validation:** Mandatory metadata input table at project creation (PO Number, Type, Reference No, Dated, Basic, Overall Multiplier, PO/Inv Value, ABG%, RA Bill with Taxes%, Erection%, PBG%) with PO item-BOQ matching, quantity, and total value verification to block project creation on mismatch.
5.  **Real-time Excel-Like Data Table:** For project metadata, with real-time calculations based on percentages, auto-save, and pre-save validation.
6.  **Integration in Project Workflow:** Company profile selection, PO metadata input/validation during project creation; GST type selection, item-level GST mapping, RA bill tracking during invoice creation.
7.  **Additional Requirements:** Fully responsive UI, permissions (Admin/Super Admin edit, Managers/Users view/select), and audit logging for company details, metadata, and GST type changes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the initial phase of enhancing the Enterprise Invoice & Project Management Tool as per the MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT. This involved:

1.  **Backend Implementation**:
    *   **Company Profile Management**: Added API endpoints for managing company profiles, locations, and bank details ().
    *   **GST Logic Upgrade / RA Bill Tracking**: Started the backend implementation for enhanced GST calculation and RA bill tracking functionality, though this was only an initial attempt and required further refinement as indicated by a Summary: I attempted to help... message.

2.  **Frontend Component Scaffolding**:
    *   Created new React components for the upcoming features:
        *   
        *   
        *   

The current state is that the backend has initial API endpoints for company profiles, and the frontend has placeholder components for the new modules. The complex logic for GST, RA tracking, and PO validation is still in early stages of implementation. The immediate next step is to continue building out these newly created components and their underlying logic.
